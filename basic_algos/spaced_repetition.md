**Spaced Repetition Recommendations:**

- First Review: After 1-2 days. The first review helps reinforce what you've
  just learned and fills any gaps.
- Second Review: 3-4 days later. At this point, you’re starting to solidify the
  understanding and can begin recalling the concepts with less effort.
- Third Review: 7-10 days later. Your brain will be less likely to forget the
  concepts, and you’ll start to internalize the logic behind binary search.
- Further Reviews: After 2-4 weeks. This helps you shift the concept from
  short-term memory into long-term memory. Occasional Maintenance: Every month
  or two after that. Just a quick refresher to keep it sharp.
