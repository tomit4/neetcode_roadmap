Given a string `s`, find the length of the <b>longest
[substring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring)</b> without repeating
characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer
must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
