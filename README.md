</div>

## Strategy

- Do a minimum of 5 problems per day
- If you get stuck for longer than 30 minutes, look at the solution, take mental
  note of what you missed, and move onto the next one or take a break.
- On Easy, aim for 15 minutes (time yourself). On Medium, aim for 25 minutes.
- Every three days go back and try and solve the problems from two days ago and
  try to solve them blind.
- Rinse and repeat until satisfied with your hit rate.
