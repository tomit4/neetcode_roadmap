[Neetcode Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RACzI5-du8&pp=ygUfbmVldGNvZGUgUGFsaW5kcm9taWMgU3Vic3RyaW5ncw%3D%3D)

Given a string `s`, return <em>the number of <b>palindromic substrings</b> in
it.</em>

A string is a <b>palindrome</b> when it reads the same backward as forward.

A <b>substring</b> is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
