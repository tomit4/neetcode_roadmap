[Neetcode Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Km3utixwZs&pp=ygUZbmVldGNvZGUgTnVtYmVyIG9mIDEgQml0cw%3D%3D)

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set
bits (A set bit refers to a bit in binary representation of a number that has a
value of `1`) in its binary representation (also known as the
[Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty
set bits.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
