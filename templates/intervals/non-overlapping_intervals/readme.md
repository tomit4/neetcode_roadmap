# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

[Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)

[Neetcode Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nONCGxWoUfM&pp=ygUibGVldGNvZGUgTm9uIE92ZXJsYXBwaW5nIEludGVydmFscw%3D%3D)

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where
`intervals[i] = [start`<sub>i</sub>`, end`<sub>i</sub>`]`, return <em>the
minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals
non-overlapping.</em>

<b>Note</b> that intervals which only touch at a point are
<b>non-overlapping</b>. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= start`<sub>i</sub>`< end`<sub>i</sub>`<= 5 * 10^4`
